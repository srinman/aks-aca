# Service Deployment Comparison: AKS vs Azure Container Apps

This document compares how to deploy and configure the underlying platform services for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and Azure Container Apps (ACA).

## Overview

The service deployment process differs significantly between AKS and Azure Container Apps, reflecting their different architectural approaches and target audiences.

## Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Deployment

### Deployment Methods

**Azure CLI**
```bash
# Create resource group
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus

# Create AKS cluster
az aks create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myAKSCluster \
    --node-count 3 \
    --enable-addons monitoring \
    --generate-ssh-keys \
    --node-vm-size Standard_D2s_v3
```

**Azure Portal**
- Guided cluster creation with configuration wizards
- Visual network and security configuration
- Integration with Azure services during creation

**ARM Templates/Bicep**
- Infrastructure as Code deployment
- Repeatable, version-controlled deployments
- Complex networking and security configurations

**Terraform**
- Multi-cloud infrastructure management
- State management and drift detection
- Community provider support

### Key Configuration Decisions

**Node Pool Configuration**
- VM sizes and scaling parameters
- Operating system selection (Linux/Windows)
- Spot instances for cost optimization
- Availability zone distribution

**Networking Architecture**
- Azure CNI vs Kubenet networking
- Network security groups and firewall rules
- Private cluster configuration
- Load balancer SKU selection

**Security Settings**
- Azure AD integration for RBAC
- Network policies (Calico, Azure NPM)
- Pod security standards
- Secrets management integration

**Add-ons and Extensions**
- Monitoring (Container Insights)
- Ingress controllers
- Service mesh (Istio)
- GitOps (Flux)

### Typical Deployment Time
- **Basic cluster**: 10-15 minutes
- **Production cluster with advanced features**: 20-30 minutes
- **Complex multi-region setup**: 1-2 hours

## Azure Container Apps Deployment

### Deployment Methods

**Azure CLI**
```bash
# Create resource group
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus

# Create Container Apps environment
az containerapp env create \
    --name myContainerAppEnv \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --location eastus
```

**Azure Portal**
- Simplified environment creation
- Built-in container app deployment wizard
- Integrated monitoring setup

**ARM Templates/Bicep**
- Infrastructure as Code support
- Environment and app deployment together
- Service binding configuration

### Key Configuration Decisions

**Environment Configuration**
- Network isolation settings
- Dapr configuration
- Log Analytics workspace integration
- Custom domain configuration

**Compute Resources**
- Consumption vs Dedicated plans
- Resource allocation limits
- Scaling parameters

**Security Settings**
- Managed identity configuration
- Network access controls
- Secret management setup

### Typical Deployment Time
- **Basic environment**: 2-3 minutes
- **Production environment with custom networking**: 5-10 minutes

## Comparison Matrix

| **Aspect** | **AKS** | **Azure Container Apps** |
|------------|---------|-------------------------|
| **Complexity** | High - requires Kubernetes knowledge | Low - simplified configuration |
| **Configuration Options** | Extensive - full Kubernetes control | Limited - opinionated defaults |
| **Deployment Time** | 10-30+ minutes | 2-10 minutes |
| **Infrastructure Exposure** | Full visibility and control | Abstracted infrastructure |
| **Networking Complexity** | Complex - multiple options | Simplified - managed networking |
| **Multi-tenancy** | Cluster-level isolation | Environment-level isolation |
| **Upgrade Management** | Manual or automated cluster upgrades | Automatic platform updates |

## Decision Factors

### Choose AKS When:
- You need full Kubernetes API access and ecosystem compatibility
- Complex networking requirements exist
- Custom operators or CRDs are required
- Multi-cluster or hybrid deployments are needed
- Team has strong Kubernetes expertise

### Choose Azure Container Apps When:
- You want simplified container deployment
- Infrastructure management overhead should be minimized
- Applications fit serverless patterns
- Team prefers PaaS-style development experience
- Cost optimization through scale-to-zero is important

## Best Practices

### AKS Deployment Best Practices
- Use system and user node pools for workload separation
- Implement network policies for security
- Configure cluster autoscaler for cost optimization
- Enable Container Insights for monitoring
- Use Azure Policy for governance

### Azure Container Apps Best Practices
- Separate environments for different stages (dev/test/prod)
- Configure appropriate CPU and memory limits
- Use managed identity for secure service access
- Implement proper secret management
- Monitor with built-in Application Insights integration

## Cost Considerations

### AKS Costs
- **Node VM costs**: Pay for all running virtual machines
- **Control plane**: Free for standard tier
- **Additional services**: Load balancers, storage, monitoring

### Azure Container Apps Costs
- **Consumption model**: Pay per vCPU second and memory GiB-second
- **Free tier**: 180,000 vCPU-seconds, 360,000 GiB-seconds monthly
- **Scale-to-zero**: No costs during idle periods
